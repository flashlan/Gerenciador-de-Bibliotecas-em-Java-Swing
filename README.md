# Gerenciador-de-Bibliotecas-em-Java-Swing

This is the open source part of one my favourite personal project: a Library manager written in java swing.

The project is on more advanced stage than here, with coupon print module, import/export to .xlsx feature, id cards feature and I`m developing a z39.50 protocol binding 

Soon I setup de ci/cd (have lots for spring but none for Swing) to project and collect the first feedback from beta user  it will be divided in two parts:

* A enterprise edition (for big libraries: eg: more tha 5000 volumes)
* A community/open source edition (to personal use and for use in little libraries)

and this repository will be updated...


Currently it have binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux.


thanks!
